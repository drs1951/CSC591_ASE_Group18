The observed explanation tax highlights the trade-off between simplicity and completeness in explanations. Simplifying complex data into concise rules misses out on nuanced details. For instance, rules like "Model >= 80" have a higher score, while complex rules like "Model >= 80 and 79 <= Volume < 91 and origin == 3" have a lower score. Thus, while explanations aim to clarify data, they may not fully capture its complexity, resulting in an "explanation tax" where simplification incurs a loss of detailed insights.
