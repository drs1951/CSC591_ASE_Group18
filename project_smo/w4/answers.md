SMO Performance Analysis

1. Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?

Answer: Yes. From the print statements, we can see that we are getting a lower average value of lbs in the case of SMO than the baseline. This indicates that SMO is performing better than baselines. Also, in the case of acc and mpg, SMO achieves higher results than all others, signifying that SMO is better than random baselines.

2. How many y-row evaluations are required for print 3?

Answer: 398

3. How does SMO do compared to the absolute best (print 3)?

Answer: When comparing the absolute best outcomes (print 3) with the mid values obtained from SMO (print 4), the following observations are made:

For the Lbs metric (lower the better), the absolute best consistently achieves 2130, whereas SMO's range is between 2305.06 and 3077.31. Thus, the absolute best performs better than SMO.

Regarding the Acc metric (higher the better), the absolute best score is 24.6, while SMO's range is between 15.28 and 16.61. Here again, the absolute best demonstrates a more optimal performance than SMO.

For the Mpg metric (higher the better), the absolute best consistently scores 40, in contrast to SMO's range of 20.45 to 32.08. This indicates that the absolute best also excels over SMO in this aspect.

Although SMO is effective in these metrics, it doesn't reach the optimization level of the absolute best results in any of them. This suggests that there's potential for further refining SMO's methodology to achieve optimal outcomes similar to those of the absolute best.
